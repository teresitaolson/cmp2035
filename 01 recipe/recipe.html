        <h2 id="top">Mom's Granola</h2>
        <p id="source"> Adapted from <cite> The Flour Cookbook</cite> by Joanne Chang</p>
        <p id="about">This clasic granola recipe is full of hearty, earthy, nutty flavors and is simply adorned with a handful of dried cranberries. Better yet, this granola recipe is fool proof!  Itâ€™s warm and nutty; perfect for a satisfying snack or breakfast.  There are many ways to enjoy this treat - as a partner for yogurt, as a crunchy side-kick to fruit, or as a perfect topping for ice cream. Mostly, I like to eat it by the handful as a slightly sweet snack for a late afternoon pick me up.</p>
